      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class ='standard-paragraph'>Striving for cutting-edge scientific research can require individuals to venture into uncharted areas on expeditions of 
        discovery for extended periods, often in resource-limited environments. Expedition Medicine (sometimes known as expeditionary medicine) 
        is the field of medicine focusing on providing embedded medical support to an expedition, usually in medically austere or isolated areas (1). 
        During expeditions, emergency or general medical care may be required and should be provided by a suitably certified professional. Despite this, 
        there are currently no postgraduate qualifications required by doctors to practise Expedition Medicine, which may result in ill-equipped medical 
        professionals working on expeditions. As both recreational and research-focused expeditions continue, the demand for physicians with the appropriate 
        skill set is ever-present. </p>
      <p class = 'standard-paragraph'>One possible solution to ensure standardised, high-quality care is by introducing Expedition Medicine as a formal 
        NHS training programme with corresponding positions, equipping doctors with the necessary skills and qualifications to practise appropriately on 
        expeditions. While the implementation of such a niche specialty may be faced with resistance, the NHS has dramatically changed over the past 75 years. 
        For example, in 2016, the General Medical Council (GMC) formalised Aviation and Space Medicine as a recognised specialty (2), thus indicating growing 
        diversity within the NHS as it looks towards the future with innovative, albeit specialised, areas of expertise.</p>
      <p class = 'standard-paragraph'>Through the lens of Expedition Medicine, the project aimed to explore the challenge of introducing a new specialty in 
        times of major healthcare upheaval with limited resources (3) and funding. Perceptions for implementation of this field of interest as a new specialty 
        were explored relating to desirability, feasibility and necessity, with an appreciation for the social and ethical factors impacting this.</p>
      <p class = 'standard-paragraph-title'>For the successful completion of the SSC project, several objectives were proposed:</p>
      <p class = 'standard-paragraph'> ​​​- Identify and consult with key stakeholders to generate a unique perspective on the desirability, feasibility, and 
        necessity of expedition medicine as an NHS speciality.</p>
      <p class = 'standard-paragraph'> - Compare the opinions of key stakeholders with the current literature to create a nuanced understanding of the 
        complexities to resource allocation (towards speciality implementation) in financially constrained health settings.</p>
      <p class = 'standard-paragraph'> - Through the exemplar of expedition medicine, integrate primary research and learning from SEAM to propose 
        recommendations for future areas of research.</p>
      <p class = 'standard-paragraph'>This project utilised qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews and open-ended survey 
        questions, and quantitative analysis of closed survey questions. Relevant ethical approval was obtained prior to research commencement. A 
        thorough review of the relevant literature was conducted prior to the completion of surveys and interviews to identify key areas of focus. 
        A detailed methodology can be found in the appendices.</p>
