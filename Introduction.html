      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="standard-paragraph">Cutting-edge scientific research can require individuals to embark into uncharted areas on expeditions of discovery 
        for extended periods of time and often in resource-limited environments. During the expeditions; emergency or general medical care may be 
        required which should be provided by a suitably certified person. Currently, there are no post-graduate qualifications necessary to practise 
        expedition medicine, leading to potentially ill-equipped doctors working on expeditions. With both recreational and research-focused expeditions 
        increasing in popularity, the demand for physicians possessing the appropriate skill set is ever-growing.  </p>
      <p class="standard-paragraph">A solution to ensure a high quality of care would be to introduce Expedition Medicine as a formal NHS speciality, 
        allowing doctors to become suitably qualified with the skill set required to provide care in an expedition setting. Although initially the 
        implementation of such a niche speciality may be faced with contention, the NHS has dramatically changed over the past 75 years, transforming 
        from a service aimed at providing quality but basic medical care into a vast and diverse array of specialities including the likes of Aviation 
        and Space Medicine, which was accepted by the GMC in 2016 (1). The ever-expanding list of unique specialities within the NHS highlights the 
        continually changing landscape of Medicine, where new discoveries and technologies allow the practice of medicine to reach new areas.</p>
      <p class="standard-paragraph">However, with the NHS facing considerable resource constraints due to mounting financial pressures, the implementation 
        of any new intervention or training pathway must be carefully considered to ensure an appropriate and fair distribution of finite resources. As such, 
        the inception of a new speciality, such as Expedition Medicine, must be suitably justified in terms of necessity, its wider impact on society, and 
        suitability for public sector funding. To explore one of the medical profession's largest challenges, that of financial and resource constraints, 
        our SSC has chosen to explore the multitude of considerations required for introducing a new speciality, through the *lens* of 
        Expedition Medicine. </p>
      <p class="standard-paragraph">The project focussed on gathering qualitative research, consisting of semi-structured interviews 
        and survey questionnaires with open questions. All ethical approval was obtained prior to research commencement. Preceding the 
        surveys and interviews a review of the literature was conducted to highlight the main areas of focus of our study. Two surveys were 
        distributed, one to obtain a detailed understanding of medical professionals’ views of expedition medicine, whilst the other focussed 
        on lay people’s perspectives. Relevant interviewees were selected due to their involvement and role within expedition medicine itself, 
        expedition experience or their career within the field of medicine. Before interviews and survey distribution, trial interviews were 
        conducted and mock surveys were sent out to ensure a high standard of questioning. The results of this data and subsequent analysis, 
        conclusions and reflection can be found in later sections. </p>
