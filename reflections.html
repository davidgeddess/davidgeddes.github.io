                <h1>Reflections</h1>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">When initially reviewing the literature, our search yielded a limited amount of 
                    relevant information. The lack of resources available pushed us to broaden our enquiry in hopes of accessing 
                    more material to analyse. Consequently, the wide variety of findings made it difficult to integrate our knowledge 
                    into a coherent overarching topic. This was tackled by brainstorming multiple research topics that could be explored 
                    and gradually streamlining down to our final choice. From the beginning, digital literacy was strongly employed to help 
                    organise and facilitate smooth teamwork, from creating a centralised hub of information on which we could all collaborate, 
                    to competently using online databases. This strength was continued in our research analysis and presentation as we created 
                    the web folio on top of the original website located here and used software such as Nvivo and Rstudio to manage thematic analysis. 
                    Both required independent learning of coding and software handling and applying these skills.</p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Continuous problem-solving was observed when establishing the 
                    cohort of interviewees, determining who to reach out to, and how to engage with them. Chasing up on 
                    slow communication was further exacerbated by the fact that individuals were often unrelated to Edinburgh 
                    Medical School, or clinical practice entirely. This hurdle was tackled by proactive communication. When preparing 
                    the semi-structured interview, we thought critically about which questions to prioritise and whether possible answers 
                    would truly contribute to addressing the topics we wanted to explore. However, this selection of questions may have been 
                    influenced by bias and preconceptions about Expedition Medicine. Again, the open nature of semi-structured interviews afforded 
                    more opportunity for investigator bias in follow-up questioning, meaning each interview produced different questions and thus 
                    answers were difficult to compare. Both these occurrences ultimately undermine the internal validity of our findings. 
                    Additionally, we struggled to ensure a fair representation of diversity across interviewees and survey respondents, 
                    hence, our findings may not reflect the population’s consensus. </p>                  
                <p class="standard-paragraph">The project was inherently a creative opportunity due to its originality and 
                    establishment by some of its members. Consequently, each person held more invested opinions and ideas, 
                    from the general direction of the project, to the wording of questions. This simultaneously encouraged 
                    everyone to exercise their intellectual autonomy and led to more disagreements and inefficiency. Furthermore, 
                    we became aware of the tendency for our meetings to lose focus due to pre-existing familiarity and friendships 
                    throughout the group. We counteracted this by ensuring meetings retained concentration through discipline and tighter schedules. </p>
                <hr>
                <p class="standard-paragraph-title2">Personal effectiveness and communication</p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">One hurdle we came across at the outset was scheduling meetings. Since our group was 
                    split between two different timetable cohorts within the year group, organising times to meet proved difficult. 
                    Although we overcame this difficulty through careful planning and communication, it continued to cause inconveniences 
                    throughout the project.</p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Whilst a strength of our group was communication, a challenge was agreeing on 
                    a universal definition of Expedition Medicine for our topic. We had to grapple with conflicting understandings 
                    of the terms ‘wilderness’ and ‘Expedition Medicine’ due to a lack of consensus within the literature. However, 
                    through careful consideration and diplomacy, this was resolved to everyones’ satisfaction.</p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Leadership was shared and changed depending on the context of the 
                    meeting and who was most experienced in the topic of focus. We delegated workload quite effectively. 
                    During our initial review of the existing literature, we divided each subsection evenly among our group 
                    in order to share the workload and maximise effectiveness. The job of handling and analysing the data from our 
                    research was taken on by a few volunteers. When delegating sections for the write-up, each subsection partnered 
                    with one person who had analysed the data with another who hadn’t, taking more responsibility for writing. Over the 
                    whole project, the distribution of work was not completely even. However, this was mostly due to individuals volunteering 
                    taking on additional responsibilities rather than anyone not fulfilling their assigned responsibilities.</p>                    
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Although meetings generally ended with a clear idea of how to proceed, a 
                    more structured meeting outline would have prevented our meetings from running overtime. Due to previous 
                    friendships within our group, we occasionally struggled to stay focused on the topic needing discussing. 
                    Having a more defined leadership role may have helped in preventing this.</p>                
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Over the course of our project, the group tended to be distracted by the 
                    potential future of the project, rather than focusing on our imminent objectives. This can be considered a 
                    strength of the group as it allowed for a more creative process and the production of higher quality work. 
                    However, it was a challenge in terms of time management, and balancing the project workload alongside other commitments.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="standard-paragraph-title2">Actively explore our mindsets</p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">As a group, our mindsets have evolved significantly over the course of the project. 
                    We have come out of it with the view that it is neither realistic nor desirable that Expedition Medicine becomes 
                    a medical specialty. </p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph"> Most group members were initially supportive of 
                    Expedition Medicine becoming a specialty, although we were aware our knowledge 
                    of the area was limited. For this reason, we decided to conduct this project to 
                    either corroborate or disprove our preconceptions.</p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Our initial mindset was likely defined by our 
                    group’s composition; medical students with an interest in expeditions and the outdoors. 
                    However, some had no direct experience of Expedition Medicine, whilst others had interacted 
                    to varying extents with the profession. This may have influenced how we conducted our initial 
                    review of the existing literature, with perhaps some bias in seeking out sources which confirmed 
                    our viewpoint. On the other hand, after reviewing the existing literature it is cited, by some group 
                    members, as the beginning of a change in mindset to a more critical one around Expedition Medicine. </p>               
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Possibly the biggest factor in changing the group’s mindset was conducting, 
                    discussing and analysing the semi-structured interviews. The more developed our understanding became of 
                    Expedition Medicine in the context of NHS resource scarcity, the more we shifted our mindset away from it 
                    becoming a specialty. Interestingly, this is mirrored in our results, as the more experience individuals had 
                    within Expedition Medicine, the more likely they were to oppose it becoming a specialty.</p>            
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Our mindsets will continue to develop in the years to come. 
                    Working in the NHS from our clinical years and beyond will lead to a more complete understanding of 
                    resource pressures. Should any of us go on to work in Expedition Medicine in the future, we will develop 
                    a more nuanced mindset, which will reflect the state of the field as it is at the time.</p>
