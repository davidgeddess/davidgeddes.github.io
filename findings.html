                <p class="standard-paragraph-title">Demographics And Overview</p>
                <p class="standard-paragraph">Demographics were collected to further interpret the results of the survey and interviews. 
                    The professional survey collected demographics from the respondents, showing a skewed distribution in all categories. 
                    The respondents were primarily female at 73.2% followed by 25.4% male, 0.7% nonbinary, and 0.7% N/A (figure 1) - this 
                    accurately reflects the gender make-up in the NHS workforce which lends proportional representation (4). Additionally, 
                    the majority of respondents identified as white at 82.6%, followed by 8.7% Asian, 7.2% Mixed, and 1.5% Other races (figure 2) - 
                    again roughly mirroring the ethnic distribution across the NHS workforce (5).​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>

                <p class="standard-paragraph">There was a wide range of age between 18 and 65, with 55% of the respondents between 18 and 24 years old 
                    (figure 3). While the majority of respondents were medical students Y1-Y6 (58%), there were many other health professions represented 
                    with 20.3% Nurses, 13.8% Doctors (at various stages of training), 0.7% paramedics and 7.2% other health professions (figure 4). 
                    The most common combination of demographics was a white female medical student between 18–24-years-old which accounted for 29% of 
                    the respondents. The public survey did not collect information on demographics as a means to simplify and quicken completion of 
                    the survey. </p>

                <p class="standard-paragraph">Of the interviewees, three out of four were current or previous doctors, with the other a non-health 
                    professional with a special interest in mountaineering/climbing expeditions, representing a key stakeholder in the consideration 
                    for Expedition Medicine as a specialty. Additionally, three were male and one female. Information on age and race was not collected 
                    in the interview process. ​​​​​​​</p>
