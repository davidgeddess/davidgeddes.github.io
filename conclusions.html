            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">Through the lens of Expedition Medicine, this study aimed to explore the challenge of 
                creating a new specialty in times of major healthcare upheaval with limited resources and funding. Perceptions for 
                implementation of this field of interest as a new specialty was explored relating to desirability, feasibility and 
                necessity, with an appreciation for the social and ethical factors impacting this.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph-title2">Reflecting on our objectives:</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">Identify and consult with key stakeholders to generate a unique perspective on the 
                desirability, feasibility, and necessity of expedition medicine as an NHS speciality.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote">A. Through the involvement of the public, expedition participants, and doctors 
                (both within and outside Expedition Medicine) data was gathered on perceptions of the implementation of Expedition 
                Medicine as a specialty with the conclusion from the public in favour of implementation, whilst professionals tended to 
                oppose it. This is a unique finding as prior to the study the literature did not address the differing opinions of the 
                public and professionals.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">Compare the opinions of key stakeholders with the current literature to create a 
                nuanced understanding of the complexities of resource allocation (towards speciality implementation) in financially 
                constrained health settings.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote"> A. The current literature highlighted resource scarcity and the financial 
                burdens of the NHS, consultations with key stakeholders found that their understanding of the present-day challenges 
                closely matched those identified in the literature.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">Through the example of expedition medicine, integrate primary research and learning from 
                SEAM to propose recommendations for future areas of research. </p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote">A. Using the key challenges identified in the SEAM course.  - ‘The Changing 
                Profession’ and ‘Health Policies, Politics, and Practise’ and combining that with the primary research found a 
                need to generate research into widening access and diversity within Expedition Medicine, as well as mitigating the 
                bureaucracy required to safely practise in this field. Applying our findings further afield, our research highlighted 
                the benefits of critical engagement with relevant stakeholders to aid in any future prospects.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">Through reviewing the literature, data gathering, and analysis, both positive 
                and negative perspectives were highlighted. Common themes for implementation were:</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote"> - The need for regulation to provide relevant training </p>  
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote"> - improved quality of care and legal protection </p>     
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote"> - NHS-funded services acting to improve inclusivity and diversity. </p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph"> Conversely, themes against the implementation were:</p> 
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote"> - Expedition Medicine is too niche a specialty</p>         
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote"> - Expedition Medicine as a specialty is not essential for the NHS </p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph-quote"> - There is a lack of benefit for the general public and that the field does not warrant public funding.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">Barriers to entering the field that were highlighted through interviews 
                and survey analysis were: lack of diversity, both in the pre-existing literature and within the field; 
                financial constraints, with high costs for training, equipment and participation; large time commitments 
                needed for expeditions; and current lack of indemnity and support for practitioners. </p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">On entering the project, the research group was keen to see the implementation of Expedition 
                Medicine as a specialty, but throughout the project, viewpoints developed. As more was learned about the interest and 
                practicalities of creating a medical specialty - especially in the context of the current climate in healthcare and wider 
                society - the consensus was that Expedition Medicine should not become a specialty. This was echoed by results from surveys 
                and interviews which showed that the greater prior knowledge of Expedition Medicine one possesses, the less one feels there 
                is a need for it to be an accredited specialty. This included sentiment from non-medical expedition participants that dedicated 
                medical doctors may not be required, and that paramedics would be better suited. Taking into account the above, we conclude that 
                it would be ethically unjustifiable to require the UK taxpayer to fund largely overseas activities that benefit a select few. In 
                addition, it would be unjustifiable, based on current resources and priorities (eg.  COVID backlog, NHS staffing inequality, 
                inadequate government policies) to continue development in this specific area.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph"> The future of medicine, alongside the successful functioning of the NHS, is dependent on systemic change. 
                Collaboration between key stakeholders is a critical aspect of this, including policymakers, patients, practitioners and third-party 
                organisations. Efficient utilisation and maximisation of the roles of these stakeholders and their resources is imperative. These groups 
                should advocate for change to ensure: adequate staffing, appropriate pay, safe working environments, increased career satisfaction, and 
                improved patient care. As the profession changes and develops, there is a requirement for a more rounded education, encompassing areas of 
                practice previously overlooked. Expedition Medicine could be a beneficial addition to future doctors' skillset, provided it is carried out 
                in a regulated manner, with clear aims to improve its diversity and accessibility. </p>            
            <p class="standard-paragraph"> The greatest recommendation for future practice from our report is that 
                Expedition Medicine should not become its own formally recognised GMC specialty. However, research shows 
                that there is a need for development of formal, consistent, evidence-based guidelines, ensuring doctors who 
                practise on expeditions possess the necessary competencies. This will ensure a consistently high standard of care. 
                Research has shown that there are a number of barriers to participation in Expedition Medicine, which relevant stakeholders 
                in the field need to work to reduce. Further research should be undertaken to focus on improving accessibility and diversity 
                within Expedition Medicine, notably the reduction of financial barriers. Furthermore, discussion is needed to create an environment 
                which allows doctors the time to engage in sabbatical experiences, furthering both their personal and professional development, such 
                as taking part in expeditions. Finally, expedition doctors require better indemnity protection to ensure more professionals are willing 
                and able to work in the field. </p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph">It is important to note the limitations of this project. Participants in the 
                surveys were recruited opportunistically, resulting in a high risk of bias. To mitigate this, in the 
                professional survey data was collected on participants' professional backgrounds and experience of expeditions, 
                allowing results to be interpreted in context. This was not the case for the survey on public perception, meaning 
                results were less able to be interpreted in context. Consequently, the results from this survey were less able to be 
                used to inform the conclusions from the project. Interview participants were recruited purposively, meaning outcomes 
                from the interviews may be vulnerable to selection bias. Recruitment challenges resulted in a low sample size of interviewees, 
                limiting any conclusions that could be drawn. Furthermore, the interviews were conducted by different members of the group, which 
                likely led to a degree of variability in the tone and body language with which questions were asked, with emphasis placed on 
                particular questions, and differing follow-up questions. The other main issue identified during data analysis was that most 
                participants fell into two polarised groups. There was a major disparity between people who knew very little about the field, 
                and those who knew a lot about the field because they were significant stakeholders in it. There were very few in the middle 
                ground, who had good knowledge of the field, but with a more dispassionate interest.</p>
            <p class="standard-paragraph-title3">Overall, based on the findings from this project, Expedition Medicine 
                should not become a specialty, but should work towards better regulation, increased accessibility and 
                establishing its niche within medicine</p>
